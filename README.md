# **Business Context**

An e-commerce company looked to optimize its user experience and improve key business metrics by analyzing website interactions, purchase behavior, and retention trends. Understanding how users move through the conversion funnel and what drives repeat purchases would guide strategy improvements.

## **Business Challenges**

1. **Conversion Funnel Performance:**
    - How effectively does the website convert product page views into purchases?
    - Where do users drop off in the process?
2. **Customer Retention Analysis:**
    - How long do users continue purchasing after their first transaction?
    - What are the month-over-month retention trends?
    - What strategies can improve long-term customer engagement?

## **Key Questions Answered**

- What percentage of users complete a purchase after viewing a product?
- Where are the biggest drop-off points in the conversion funnel?
- How do retention rates change over time, and what factors impact customer loyalty?
- What potential strategies could improve conversion rates and retention?

# **Approach**

- **Conversion Funnel Analysis:** Tracked users across three funnel stages: product views, cart additions, and purchases.
- **Cohort-Based Retention Analysis**: Grouped customers into cohorts based on first purchase month, monitoring retention over time.

# **Key Insights**

- **Conversion Funnel Performance:**
    - Only 10.34% of users who view a product complete a purchase.
    - 29.04% add an item to their cart, but thereâ€™s a significant drop-off before checkout.
    - 35.61% of users with items in their cart proceed to complete their purchase.
    - Opportunity: Streamlining the cart-to-checkout process could increase conversions.
- **Retention Trends:**
    - Retention drops sharply after Month 1, with most cohorts seeing a decline to single-digit percentages by Month 3.
    - By Month 4, fewer than 3% of users from each cohort remain actively purchasing.
    - Opportunity: Re-engagement strategies such as targeted marketing, loyalty programs, or exclusive deals could improve retention.
